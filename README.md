# ahk_scripts
A collection of AutoHotKey (v2.0+ only) scripts that I use, mainly for work.

## Usage:
To use these scripts, need to install AutoHotKey (v2.x) from [AutoHotKey.com](https://www.autohotkey.com/) then:
1. Place the files into your startup folder (Win+R > `Shell:startup` to open the folder)
2. Double click the "ahk_main" file to start the script
3. Done

#### Note:
You don't need to run any of the otehr scripts as these are referenced by the "ahk_main" file and contain no active hotkeys.
